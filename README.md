Hello! 

I have created this TasknTimeKeeper Program in order to familarize myself with JIRA logging. I will be maintaining this project until it I feel it is complete! Feel free to look around and use this project as you wish! 

## Features
- Fetch unresolved tasks assigned to the user.
- Start/Stop time tracking for specific tasks.
- Automatically log time spent on tasks to JIRA.
